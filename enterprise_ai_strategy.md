# **Beyond AI Agents: The Future of Enterprise AI**

**Full Presentation Script (Parable-Threaded Edition)**

---

## **Slide 1 — Beyond AI Agents: The Future of Enterprise AI**

> I want to start with a short parable.
>
> There’s an old story about six blind men and an elephant.
> Each touches a different part—the trunk, the leg, the tail—and each walks away convinced they understand what an elephant is.
>
> They’re all right.
> And they’re all wrong.
>
> That story captures where we are with enterprise AI today.
>
> Each of us is touching a different part of the same thing—and drawing very confident conclusions.
>
> Today is about stepping back, seeing the whole elephant, and making better decisions about how AI fits into the enterprise.

---

## **Slide 2 — Executive Summary**

> AI isn’t one thing.
>
> It’s not a single product, platform, or moment on a hype cycle.
>
> It’s a collection of capabilities—each at a different level of maturity, risk, and value.
>
> The challenge for CIOs isn’t access to AI.
> It’s interpretation.
>
> When organizations move too quickly from touching one part of the elephant to declaring, *“This is the future,”* they often miss where real value actually comes from.
>
> AI value is a journey.
> And it’s a human journey as much as a technical one.

## **Slide 3 — The AI Hype Cycle: A Composite View**

> One reason AI conversations feel so fragmented is because everyone is experiencing a different slice of it.
>
> Some teams encounter generative AI and see inconsistency and hallucinations.
> Others see agents and imagine automation at scale.
>
> Like the parable, they’re interacting with real parts of the system—but not the whole.
>
> AI doesn’t sit at one point on the hype cycle.
>
> Different capabilities are maturing at different speeds, and confusion happens when we collapse them into a single narrative.

---

## **Slide 4 — Where AI Capabilities Sit Today**

> Today, foundational models and generative AI are moving into the **Trough of Disillusionment**.
>
> Expectations are resetting.
> Reality is setting in.
>
> At the same time, agentic AI is climbing toward the **Peak of Inflated Expectations**.
>
> And quietly, some AI capabilities are already delivering value—well past the hype.
>
> The mistake is assuming the part of the elephant you’re touching defines the whole animal.
>
> Strategy requires knowing *which* capability you’re dealing with—and *where* it actually sits.

## **Slide 5 — The “AI for AI’s Sake” Problem**

> One of the most common failure patterns we see is AI adopted out of fear.
>
> Fear of missing out.
> Fear of falling behind.
>
> Someone touches one part of the elephant and declares, *“This is it—we need this everywhere.”*
>
> But without a clear business objective, AI becomes noise.
>
> Successful organizations don’t ask, *“What can this AI do?”*
> They ask, *“What problem are we trying to solve?”*

## **Slide 6 — The Wrapper Concept: Making AI Useful**

> Raw AI capability is rarely useful on its own.
>
> It needs context.
>
> A summarization model means very different things to:
>
> * Sally in recruitment
> * Tom in procurement
> * Sarah in marketing
>
> Same elephant.
> Different grip.
>
> The wrapper—people, process, or technology—is what turns a general capability into role-specific value.
>
> Without it, AI remains abstract.
> With it, AI becomes operational.

## **Slide 7 — Change Management Is the Real Investment**

> This is where many AI programs underestimate the work.
>
> The technology may be impressive—but adoption is human.
>
> Change management often costs **100 to 200 percent** of the technology investment.
>
> And it’s not optional.
>
> When people don’t understand what part of the elephant they’re touching—or why—it creates fear.
>
> AI literacy, participation, governance, and ethics aren’t overhead.
> They’re how trust is built.

## **Slide 8 — Demystifying AI Value Realization**

> Another misconception is speed.
>
> AI responds instantly—but value doesn’t.
>
> Improving one component of the system doesn’t move the organization forward if everything else is misaligned.
>
> Touching the elephant’s leg doesn’t make it walk.
>
> Value emerges when the entire system—people, process, and technology—moves together.

## **Slide 9 — The Three-Tier Use Case Framework**

> A useful way to manage expectations is to think in three tiers.
>
> **Defend**:
> Broad, everyday AI tools.
> Cultural value. Confidence. Familiarity.
>
> **Extend**:
> AI embedded into core workflows.
> Measurable efficiency and quality gains.
>
> **Upend**:
> Strategic bets on future disruption.
>
> Each tier touches a different part of the elephant.
>
> Problems arise when we expect Defend use cases to deliver Upend-level returns—or vice versa.

## **Slide 10 — AI Agents: A Bridge, Not a Destination**

> AI agents are powerful—and compelling.
>
> They feel intuitive because they mirror human roles.
>
> That framing has helped people understand AI more quickly.
>
> But agents perform **tasks within roles**, not entire jobs.
>
> Touching the elephant’s head doesn’t mean you understand its entire nervous system.
>
> Agents matter—but they are a bridge, not the destination.

## **Slide 11 — Strategic Stance for CIOs**

> The most effective CIOs hold three time horizons at once.
>
> They respect the past—legacy systems and investments aren’t disappearing.
>
> They focus on the present—solving mission-critical problems today.
>
> And they stay aware of the future—without letting it derail execution.
>
> Seeing the whole elephant requires patience and perspective—not urgency alone.

---

## **Slide 12 — Looking Beyond Five Years**

> Over the longer term, we’ll likely see new forms of differentiation.
>
> “AI-free” certifications.
> A premium on human-created content.
> Human service as a luxury experience.
>
> These aren’t rejections of AI.
>
> They’re signals that trust, transparency, and intent will matter more than raw capability.

## **Slide 13 — From AGI to ACI**

> Much attention is focused on AGI and ASI.
>
> But a more practical—and powerful—future is emerging.
>
> **Augmented Collective Intelligence**.
>
> Humans and AI working together.
>
> The goal isn’t perfection.
>
> It’s being demonstrably better than humans alone at specific tasks—while keeping humans in the loop.
>
> That’s not replacing the elephant.
> That’s learning how to move with it.

---

## **Slide 14 — Starting the Journey**

> The right starting point isn’t use cases.
>
> It’s strategy.
>
> Define your AI ambition.
> Align stakeholders.
> Commit to change.
>
> Transformation requires effort.
>
> Or, as the saying goes:
>
> Everyone wants to go to heaven—but no one wants to die.

## **Slide 15 — Key Principles for Success (Closing)**

> To close, a few principles.
>
> Be participative.
> Leverage past transformation experience.
> Balance optimism with discipline.
> Build guardrails early.
>
> AI is powerful—but it’s not magic.
>
> The organizations that succeed won’t be the ones that grabbed the elephant first.
>
> They’ll be the ones that stepped back, saw it clearly, and chose—deliberately—how to move forward.
>
> Thank you.
